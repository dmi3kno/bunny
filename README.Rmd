The goal of **`bunny`** is to provide useful functions for working with `{magick}` package.

## Installation

You can install the released version of bunny from [Github](https://www.github.com) with:

``` r
#install.packages("bunny") # not yet
remotes::install_github("dmi3kno/bunny")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(bunny)
library(magick)
## basic example code
frink <- image_read("https://jeroen.github.io/images/frink.png")
image_getpixel(frink, geometry_point(100,100))
```

Other than extracting color from individual pixels, `bunny` can also draw on images:

```{r, fig.height=5}
frink <- image_read("https://jeroen.github.io/images/frink.png")
image_plot(frink, geometry_area(50,35,80,150), "red")
image_plot(frink, geometry_point(70,70), "red")
```

Stay tuned for more exciting functions...
